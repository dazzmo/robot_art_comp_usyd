# robot_art_comp_usyd

Hello! This is our code for the International Robot Art Competition. We use a skeletonisation approach to approximate the brushstroke paths in an image. The image is then recreated as an ink painting on an xy-plotter. The painting Our work is inspired by Chinese and Japanese traditional ink paintings.

Running main.m inside the matlab folder will produce the relevant g-code that can be sent to the EleksDraw xy-plotter to produce a painting of the input image.
